**Privacy Policy for Alexa Skill**

This privacy policy describes how "bollettino covid" protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using my Alexa Skill , please read this policy and my Alexa Skill Terms of Use, as well as the Alexa Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).

Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.

If you use my skill you fully agree to this privacy policy.

**General**

When you use my skill you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and to my skill to understand what my skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for my service to give you an appropriate answer.

**Data**

I never collect or share personal data with my skill.

To improve my services I analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

**Changes**

My skill or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of my skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
